## Link Template

### JSON-LD mapping

This Building block maps variables to **blank nodes** - this means that multiple mappings can co-exist in a system without clashing, even if the same variable name is re-used.

(if identification of variables is required at a global level @id can be used in variable names)

### Tests:
 
tests if variables present in uriTemplates exist in variable declarations using SHACL
