                is

                WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)

                unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.


                If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system
                is WGS 84

                longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)

                unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.


                For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
                of

                minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
                latitude.

                However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value

                (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box
                edge).


                If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are

                the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.


                If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision
                of the

                server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to
                determine

                the extent or all relevant geometries.'
